# Nice Telegram Bot

Do you regularly chat with people on Telegram, and post links to articles in groupchats? Then you probably know the huge struggle of coming up with a proper response when you appreciate the other person sending that link. Sure, you can say "nice". But then they send another article, and you appreciate it so you respond "nice" again. Now the other person thinks your just being sarcastic.

Introducing [@goedbot](https://telegram.me/goedbot). It will help you come up with a fresh "nice" response each time. It's in Dutch, so ehh if you don't speak Dutch you will not understand this and you've just wasted your time reading this.

*Now also with "medium" and "bad" responses!*
